# Grammarly Selenium Automation Project

This project is a Prof of Concept that automation with [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com/) even without API is possible.

Project uses [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) with [Beautiful Soap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape data from Grammarly document checking.

Main purpose is for reusing this `pseudo-api` in a [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) plugin to automatically check correctness of article in Grammarly service.
